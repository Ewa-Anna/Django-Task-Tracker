# React-Django-Task-Tracker
This repository contains a full-stack task management system built with React and Django.

The application allows users to create, edit, and organize tasks effectively. The frontend, developed with React, provides an intuitive user interface for task management, while the backend, powered by Django and Django Rest Framework, manages task data, user authentication, and more. The project leverages the power of React for dynamic and responsive interactions, coupled with the robustness of Django for secure backend operations.
